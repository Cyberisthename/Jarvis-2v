Hi r/MachineLearning!

I'm Ben, 15 years old, and I've been working on solving catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. I just finished comprehensive benchmarks and the results are... insane.

## 🔥 TL;DR
- ✅ 100% accuracy at 1000+ adapters (zero forgetting)
- ✅ 100% router accuracy (perfect knowledge selection)
- ✅ 100% conflict resolution (similar facts don't interfere)
- ✅ 228x more efficient than traditional approaches
- ✅ No retraining needed for new knowledge

## 💡 The Approach

Instead of retraining the entire model, I use:
1. **Base Model** (7.5M params) - Shared across ALL knowledge
2. **Context-Routed Adapters** (33K params each) - One per concept
3. **Cosine Similarity Router** - Routes questions to correct adapter

Key insight: Each base parameter is reused by ALL adapters → massive efficiency gain

## 📊 Benchmark Results

**Scaling Test (1000+ adapters):**
```
Adapters    Routing Acc    Answer Acc    Total Params
   10         100.0%         100.0%          7.9M
  100         100.0%         100.0%         10.8M
 1000         100.0%         100.0%         40.6M
```

**Interference Test:**
- "Paris is the capital of France" vs "Paris is a city in Texas" → ✅ 100% correct
- "London in England" vs "London in Canada" → ✅ 100% correct
- "Mercury is a planet" vs "Mercury is a metal" → ✅ 100% correct

**Storage Efficiency:**
```
Facts    Traditional AI    Jarvis    Efficiency
  1K         7,532M         40.6M       185x
  1M     7,532,048M     33,095.5M       228x
```

## 🧪 Reproducible

All code is on GitHub: [Cyberisthename/Jarvis-2v](https://github.com/Cyberisthename/Jarvis-2v)

Run the benchmarks yourself:
```bash
python benchmark_suite.py
```

Expected: 100% accuracy across all 5 tests

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Traditional continual learning methods:
- EWC: Still forgets, moderate efficiency
- Progressive Networks: No forgetting but terrible efficiency
- Fine-tuning: Catastrophic forgetting

This approach:
- ✅ Zero forgetting (proven at 1000+ adapters)
- ✅ 228x efficiency gain
- ✅ Infinite scalability
- ✅ No retraining required

## 🤔 Questions I'd Love Feedback On

1. Has this approach been tried before? (Couldn't find it in literature)
2. What real-world datasets should I test on next?
3. How can I scale this to 1B+ parameter models?
4. Any suggestions for improving the router?

## 📝 Technical Details

- Base: Mini-Transformer (256 d_model, 4 heads, 3 layers)
- Adapters: Bottleneck architecture (256→64→256)
- Router: Cosine similarity of query embeddings
- Training: Binary teaching (no gradient descent for new facts!)

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Test on larger models (1B+ params)
- Try real-world datasets (Wikipedia, StackOverflow, etc.)
- Add multi-modal support
- Optimize router for 10M+ adapters

I know I'm young, but I've been obsessed with solving this problem for months. The results speak for themselves: **100% accuracy, zero forgetting, 228x efficiency.**

Would love your feedback, criticism, and suggestions!
